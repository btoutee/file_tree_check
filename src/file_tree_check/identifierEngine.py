class IdentifierEngine:
    """Class that can extract an "identifier" from a path.

    The identifier is a name that is used for comparison between directories and
    should not contain any part that is unique (like a subject number).
    The regular expression in the config files are relied on
    to remove these unique parts of the file/directory name.

    Example:

    "sub-15464521_image.png" and "sub-25484441_image.png"
    would both have the same identifier "_image.png"
    if using a regular expression that is keeping everything
    after the first "_" like "/_.*$/".

    Attributes
    ----------
    file_expression: string
        The regular expression to filter the identifier from the name of files.

    directory_expression: string
        The regular expression to filter the identifier from the name of directories.

    logger: logging.Logger
        Logger to save info and debug message.
        Will send the log lines to the appropriate outputs following
        the logger configuration in main.py.

        """Extract the identifier from the file/directory.

        The identifier should be the repeating part of the name that ties it
        to it's type for comparison

            "sept_6_weekly_report.txt" -> "_weekly_report.txt"

        However the details of what precisely to extract and treat as an identifier
        is handled by the regular expressions given on creating the class instance.
        Since the regular expression is used with re.search(), only the first match is kept.

        If no match is found, the entire file/directory name is used instead
        since we prefer to have identifier
        that are unique but can still be used in the output vs an empty identifier.

        Extraction method with the default regular expression:

        .. code-block::

            Files = "_.*$" ; Keep everything after the first "_". to remove the subject number.
            Directories = "^.*-" ; Keep everything until the first "-".

            ; This way, subject directories like "sub-012012" are all aggregated
            ; under "sub-" while directory names without "-" are kept entirely.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path: pathlib.Path or string
            The path to the file/directory for which to extract the identifier.

        prefix_file_with_parent_directory: bool, default = False
            Whether to include the parent directory as a prefix to the file's identifier.
            This is used to discriminate files that have the same name
            but are located under different subdirectories
            when filename are expected to be found at multiple places
            for each subject/configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        identifier: string
            The path's extracted identifier. Will be used to aggregate data on files/directories
            with the same identifier across the repeating file structure.
